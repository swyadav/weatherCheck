#This file shows how to run the program.
1. The HOT.properties and COLD.properties file contains the list of commands and their values
2. WeatherCheck is the main class that takes in the input as command line arguments and parses and produces output.
3. The temperature provided should have a similar properties file.
4. Person class contains all the necessary attributes.
5. Validations class performs all the validations based on the input command and person's current state.
6. Commands class loads the properties file and stores the input commands and their value.It is a singleton class.


#Approached used.
I have tried to make the program as simple as possible. I wanted to make the program more generic if anyone wanted to
extend to other temperatures ex. RAINY etc. To do this I have used properties file which contains the input commands and
their valid values. The properties file is loaded only once based on the temperature provided and stored in a singleton
object. The validations class is final class which performs all the validations based on the current state of the person.
The Person class contains all the properties of the person.
